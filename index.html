        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring front end web developer who looks forward to creating beautiful websites. I have lived in a few different countries and I believe I can bring different perspectives and fresh ideas to any company.</p>
        <p>For the past 9 years I've worked as a system administrator, but I wanted more for myself. Mostly, the ability to use my creativity. I've always been interested in learning how to code, but I had to get over a mental block of doubting if I'm even smart enough to code. It was a long time in the making, but it's 2019 and I'm here now.</p>
